**Hello!**

Welcome to Nathan (Pang)'s guide to firewalls and backends on Archlinux.

Firewalls are meant to protect your computer by limiting data that goes into your computer while allowing data to be sent from your computer.

**Installing a Firewall**

The firewall we will be using is ufw. Ufw stands for Uncomplicated Firewall. To install ufw, use the following command:

    `sudo pacman -S ufw`
